My first ever coding project!(credit to Colt Steele web developer course 2021)\
Building a small web application project with node, express, mongoDB, bootstrape\
\
What I learned so far:\
-defining restful API routes, perform basic CRUD functionality \
-basic authentication and authorization \
-MVC design patterns (Models, views, controllers) \
-packages for some misc features (flash messages, image file uploading, Mapbox api to display campground locations) \
-includes modules for basic security issues (mongo injection, XSS scripting, helmet packages) \
-finally my first deployment on heroku! \

Working on: \
-pagination & lazy loading features on displaying campgrounds instead of fetching all data at once to improve performance
